# AirBnB Clone - The Console

This project is the backend foundation of an AirBnB-like web application. It starts with a custom-built command interpreter that lets you manage the core objects of the system (Users, Places, Reviews, etc.) via a CLI.

This is the first step toward building a full web application â€” the command interpreter lets you create, update, destroy, and view data stored in JSON.

---

## Project Description

This backend system allows you to:

- Create new data models (like users or places)
- Retrieve the string representation of existing models
- Update model attributes
- Destroy model instances
- Store and load all data from a JSON file

The interpreter works in both interactive and non-interactive modes.
